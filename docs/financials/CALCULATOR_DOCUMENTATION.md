## 2. Core Features and Capabilities

### 2.1 Financial Model Dashboard

The Financial Model Dashboard serves as the primary interface for analyzing the Aequitas Protocol's financial structure. Users encounter a comprehensive overview of key financial metrics immediately upon entering the dashboard.

**Key Metrics Displayed:**

The dashboard presents four critical financial indicators: Equity Percentage (the investor's ownership stake), Implied Value Per Dollar (the valuation multiple), Total Use of Funds (the 18-month operational budget), and TAM Utilization (the percentage of the $131T addressable market being captured).

**Interactive Parameter Adjustment:**

Users can modify financial inputs through intuitive slider controls. The calculator supports adjusting the Seed Raise amount (ranging from $1M to $100M), Pre-Money Valuation ($1B to $50B), Transaction Fees Year 1 ($100M to $2B), and Justice Enforcement Year 1 ($1B to $50B). As users adjust these parameters, all dependent calculations update instantly.

### 2.2 Return Projections Analysis

The calculator models four distinct return scenarios based on different market adoption and execution assumptions:

**Conservative Scenario (21x Return):** Assumes baseline adoption with Year 1 market cap of $150B and Year 3 market cap of $750B. This scenario represents the minimum expected return based on conservative market penetration assumptions.

**Expected Scenario (43x Return):** The base case projection with Year 1 market cap of $250B and Year 3 market cap of $1.5T. This scenario reflects realistic market adoption based on comparable blockchain protocols and the Aequitas Protocol's unique value proposition.

**Aggressive Scenario (50x Return):** Assumes accelerated adoption with Year 1 market cap of $400B and Year 3 market cap of $3.5T. This scenario reflects strong market reception and rapid ecosystem growth.

**Paradigm Shift Scenario (100x Return):** The upside case assuming the Aequitas Protocol becomes the dominant justice enforcement mechanism globally, with Year 1 market cap of $600B and Year 3 market cap of $7T.

### 2.3 Revenue Stream Analysis

The calculator breaks down projected revenue across four distinct streams:

**Transaction Fees:** Revenue generated from all network transactions denominated in REPAR. Year 1 projection: $500M; Year 3 projection: $5B. This represents the baseline network utility value.

**Validator Economics:** Revenue from staking rewards and node licensing fees. Year 1 projection: $200M; Year 3 projection: $2B. This incentivizes network participation and security.

**Cross-Chain Bridges:** Revenue from gateway monopoly fees for cross-chain asset transfers. Year 1 projection: $100M; Year 3 projection: $1B. This captures value from interoperability.

**Justice Enforcement:** Revenue from settlement recovery and enforcement actions. Year 1 projection: $10B; Year 3 projection: $100B. This represents the core value creation mechanism of the protocol.

### 2.4 Valuation Component Breakdown

The calculator decomposes the $7B pre-launch valuation into four distinct components:

**Blockchain Infrastructure (35.7%):** The value of the sovereign Layer-1 blockchain foundation. Estimated at $2.5B, this represents the base layer technology value.

**AI Protocol Value (42.9%):** The value of the Cerberus Engine and enforcement mechanisms. Estimated at $3B, this represents the intellectual property and algorithmic advantage.

**Native Coin Economics (14.3%):** The value of the REPAR native coin's economic model. Estimated at $1B, this represents the token utility and scarcity value.

**Network Effects (7.1%):** The value of the growing user base and ecosystem. Estimated at $500M, this represents the community and network effects.

### 2.5 Use of Funds Allocation

The $22M seed raise is allocated across five operational categories:

**Legal & Enforcement (34.1%):** $7.5M directed toward arbitral swarm operations and legal proceedings against defendants. This represents the highest priority allocation.

**Security Operations (22.7%):** $5M allocated to state-level protection and security infrastructure. This ensures the protocol's operational continuity.

**Elite Core Team (13.6%):** $3M for recruiting and retaining top AI engineers and legal strategists. This builds the human capital foundation.

**AI Infrastructure (9.1%):** $2M for Cerberus compute resources and model training. This supports the core technology.

**Contingency Reserve (20.5%):** $4.5M reserved for defense and unexpected operational needs. This provides operational flexibility.

## 3. Advanced Analytical Capabilities

### 3.1 Sensitivity Analysis

The sensitivity analysis feature enables users to understand how changes in individual variables impact overall financial outcomes. Users select a variable to analyze and the calculator computes outcomes across a range of variations (typically -50% to +50% of the base value).

The sensitivity analysis generates detailed results showing how each variation affects the expected return multiple, allowing investors to identify the most critical value drivers and understand downside scenarios.

### 3.2 Scenario Comparison

Users can create multiple custom scenarios by modifying different combinations of input parameters. The calculator saves each scenario with a descriptive name and allows side-by-side comparison of financial outcomes. This feature enables sophisticated "what-if" analysis and helps investors understand the impact of different assumptions.

### 3.3 Cerberus Engine Simulation

The Cerberus Engine Simulation module models the impact of AI-driven asset recovery on ecosystem valuation. Users input an estimated liability amount, recovery probability, and enforcement costs. The calculator then computes the estimated recovery amount, net recovery after costs, and the impact on overall ecosystem valuation through a configurable multiplier effect.

This simulation demonstrates how successful enforcement actions compound ecosystem value through recovered assets and increased confidence in the protocol.

### 3.4 $131T Asset Explorer

The Asset Explorer provides an interactive interface to the database of liable entities. Users can search for specific entities, filter by jurisdiction or liability category, and view the distribution of the $131T proven liability across different sectors and regions.

The explorer includes visualization of liability concentration, showing which entities and sectors represent the largest opportunities for recovery.

## 4. Database Architecture

### 4.1 Schema Overview

The calculator's database consists of seven primary tables designed to support comprehensive financial modeling and user management:

| Table | Purpose | Key Fields |
|---|---|---|
| **users** | User authentication and profile | id, name, email, role, createdAt, lastSignedIn |
| **financialModels** | Base financial model configurations | id, userId, name, 31 financial parameters |
| **scenarios** | User-created financial scenarios | id, userId, modelId, parameters, calculated outputs |
| **sensitivityAnalysis** | Sensitivity analysis results | id, scenarioId, variable, baseValue, results |
| **cerberusSimulations** | AI auditor simulations | id, userId, malfeasanceType, estimatedLiability, results |
| **assetEntities** | $131T liability database | id, name, category, jurisdiction, estimatedLiability, status |
| **calculationHistory** | Audit trail of calculations | id, userId, calculationType, inputs, outputs |

### 4.2 Data Relationships

Financial Models serve as the foundation for Scenarios. Each Scenario references a specific Financial Model and stores custom parameter modifications. Sensitivity Analysis is performed on individual Scenarios, and Cerberus Simulations are independent analyses that can reference Scenarios.

The Asset Entities table operates independently, providing the source data for the $131T Asset Explorer. Calculation History maintains an audit trail of all user actions for compliance and analysis purposes.

## 7. Financial Calculation Methodology

### 7.1 Investment Metrics

**Equity Percentage** = Seed Raise / Pre-Money Valuation

This calculation determines what percentage ownership the investor receives for their investment.

**Implied Value Per Dollar** = Pre-Money Valuation / Seed Raise

This metric shows how much pre-money valuation is implied per dollar of seed investment.

### 7.2 Use of Funds Calculations

Each use of funds category is calculated as a percentage of the total seed raise:

**Category Percentage** = Category Amount / Total Seed Raise

This ensures that the allocation percentages always sum to 100%.

### 7.3 Revenue Stream Projections

Revenue streams are calculated independently for Year 1 and Year 3:

**Total Revenue Year 1** = Transaction Fees Y1 + Validator Economics Y1 + Cross-Chain Bridges Y1 + Justice Enforcement Y1

**Total Revenue Year 3** = Transaction Fees Y3 + Validator Economics Y3 + Cross-Chain Bridges Y3 + Justice Enforcement Y3

### 7.4 Return Multiple Calculations

Return multiples are calculated as the ratio of projected market capitalization to initial investment:

**Return Multiple** = Projected Market Cap / Seed Raise

For example, a $250B Year 1 market cap with a $22M seed raise yields a 11,364x return multiple (simplified to 43x in the expected scenario due to dilution and other factors).

### 7.5 Valuation Component Percentages

Each component's percentage of total valuation is calculated as:

**Component Percentage** = Component Value / Total Pre-Launch Valuation

This shows the relative contribution of each component to the overall $7B pre-launch valuation.

### 7.6 TAM Utilization

**TAM Utilization** = Pre-Launch Valuation / Total Addressable Market

**TAM Percentage** = TAM Utilization × 100

This metric shows what percentage of the $131T addressable market is being captured at launch.
