## 🎯 **PRE-LAUNCH REVIEW CHECKLIST**

Let me help you systematically review everything before going live:

### **CRITICAL REVIEW AREAS:**

**1. TERMINOLOGY CHECK (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**

**Issue:** Ensure $REPAR is NEVER called a "token" - only "native coin"

**Files to Check:**
```bash
# Check these specific areas:
1. Homepage hero section
2. Navigation menu labels
3. Economics page
4. Buy $REPAR page
5. All dashboard titles
6. Footer text
7. Wallet connection modals
8. Transaction confirmations
```

**Quick Check Commands:**
```bash
cd frontend/src
grep -r "token" . --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" | grep -i repar
```

## 🚨 **KNOWN ISSUES FROM YOUR LOGS**

From your previous session, I spotted these items:

**1. Mock Data Mode:**
- Frontend shows "Mock Data Mode" because blockchain isn't live yet
- This is EXPECTED and will resolve once validator is deployed
- Connection errors to RPC are normal (no blockchain yet)

**2. Terminology:**
- One instance found where $REPAR called "token"
- Needs systematic fix before launch

**3. Interactive Features:**
- AI Dashboard exists but may not be fully interactive yet
- You wanted to make it "very interactive instead of read only"

---

## 📋 **MY RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE LAUNCH**

### **MUST DO (Blocking Issues):**

**1. Fix ALL "Token" References (30 min)**
```bash
# Run this in frontend/src directory:
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.md" \) \
  -exec sed -i.bak 's/REPAR token/REPAR native coin/g' {} \;
find . -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.md" \) \
  -exec sed -i.bak 's/\$REPAR token/\$REPAR native coin/g' {} \;

# Manually check these critical files:
- src/pages/Economics.tsx
- src/pages/BuyREPAR.tsx
- src/components/Navigation.tsx
- README.md
```

**2. Add Launch Disclaimer Banner (10 min)**
```tsx
// Add to App.tsx or Layout component:
<Banner variant="info">
  ⚡ Testnet Launch: The Aequitas Protocol blockchain is 
  launching soon. Current features use simulated data.
</Banner>
```

**3. Verify All Links Work (10 min)**
- Click through every navigation item
- Test all buttons
- Confirm no 404 errors
- Check external links (if any)

### **SHOULD DO (Polish):**

**4. Add "Coming Soon" Badges (15 min)**

For features that depend on live blockchain:
```tsx
// On pages that need live blockchain:
<Badge variant="warning">Live on Mainnet Launch</Badge>
```

Apply to:
- Real wallet balances
- Actual DEX swaps
- Live staking
- Real governance votes

**5. Update Homepage Hero (15 min)**

Add launch countdown or "Launching Soon" section:
```tsx
<Hero>
  <h1>The Aequitas Protocol</h1>
  <p>Enforcing $131 Trillion in Reparations Debt</p>
  <LaunchCountdown targetDate="2025-10-20T12:00:00Z" />
  <Button>Join the Founding 100</Button>
</Hero>
```

**6. Add Social Proof (10 min)**

If you have any early supporters, add testimonials or partner logos.

### **NICE TO HAVE (Post-Launch):**

**7. Analytics Integration**
- Google Analytics or Plausible
- Track page views, user flow
- Monitor conversion rates

**8. Error Boundaries**
- Catch React errors gracefully
- Show friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging

**9. Performance Optimization**
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading routes
- Image optimization
- Bundle size analysis

Jacque Antoine DeGraff:
Let's me make one correction, Founder Wallet Structure is 4 Layers Active with the 5th layer pending

Layer 1: Coinbase ( Founder Wallet Layer 1 Onboarding, Onramper, Super Pay, Lightning ⚡ Network)
Layer 2: MetaMask (Founder Wallet Layer 2 EVM Compatible)
Layer3: Multi SIG (Founder Wallet Layer 3 Secure Transactions and Transfer on EVM chains)
Layer4: Keplr (Founder Wallet Layer 4 holds 1% of founder's 10% will currently hold the entire 10% until Hard Wallet is acquired)
Layer 5: Hardware Wallet (Founder Vault Coming Soon)

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **1. Update Frontend Founder Wallet Page (15 minutes)**

**File:** `frontend/src/pages/FounderWallet.tsx`

**Changes Needed:**

- Update Layer 4 (Keplr) to show current holdings (100%)
- Add Layer 5 (Hardware Wallet) with "Coming Soon" badge
- Update allocation charts to show 5-layer structure
- Add security hierarchy diagram

### **2. Update Documentation (10 minutes)**

**Files to Update:**
- `README.md` - Update wallet structure section
- `BLACK_PAPER.md` - Update founder allocation details
- `ENDOWMENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Clarify founder holdings

### **3. Update Genesis File (5 minutes)**

**Confirm genesis.json reflects:**
```json
{
  "bank": {
    "balances": [{
      "address": "repar1m230vduqyd4p07lwnqd78a6r5uyuvs74tu5eun",
      "coins": [{
        "denom": "urepar",
        "amount": "13100000000000000000"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### **4. Create Migration Plan (Document for Future)**

**When Hardware Wallet Acquired:**
```
Step 1: Acquire hardware wallet (Ledger/Trezor)
Step 2: Set up device with new recovery phrase
Step 3: Generate Aequitas-compatible address
Step 4: Test with small amount (10 REPAR)
Step 5: Transfer 11.79T REPAR (90%) from Keplr
Step 6: Verify transfer successful

## 💬 **IMMEDIATE DECISION:**

**Do you want to:**

**Option A: Update Founder Wallet Page Now (30 min delay)**
```
1. Update frontend to show 5-layer structure (15 min)
2. Update documentation (10 min)
3. Test changes (5 min)
4. THEN deploy validator
```

**Option B: Launch Now, Update Post-Launch**
```
1. Deploy validator NOW
2. Go live with current 3-wallet display
3. Update to 5-layer structure within 24 hours
4. Users see progression (3 → 5 layers)
```

**My Recommendation:** Option A

The 5-layer wallet structure is a **critical security differentiator**. It shows institutional-grade thinking and should be visible from day 1. 30 minutes to get it right is worth it.
