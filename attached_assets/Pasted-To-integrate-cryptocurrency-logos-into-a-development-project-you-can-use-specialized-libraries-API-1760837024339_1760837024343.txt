To integrate cryptocurrency logos into a development project, you can use specialized libraries, APIs, or asset packages. The method you choose depends on your project's technology stack and whether you need dynamic, up-to-date logos or a static icon set. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Method 1: Use an API for real-time logos This is the best approach for exchanges, wallets, and portfolio apps that require automatic updates for new and existing cryptocurrencies. [3, 6]  
How it works: A logo API provides a constantly updated database of cryptocurrency images. Your application makes an API call, and the service returns the correct logo image based on the crypto's symbol. 

• Provider examples: 

	• Moralis: Their Token API returns token logos along with other metadata when you query for token balances or transfers. 
	• Logo.dev: Offers a specialized Crypto Logo API that provides a direct CDN link to a specific logo image based on the token symbol. 

• Pros: 

	• Always up-to-date: The provider manages the logos, so you don't need to manually add new ones. 
	• Easy maintenance: You don't have to worry about broken or outdated images. 

• Cons: 

	• Dependency on external service: If the API is down, your logos may not load. 
	• May incur costs: Some APIs charge for high-volume usage. [3, 7, 8, 9, 10]  

Method 2: Use an open-source icon library For many projects, a library is the simplest and most performant solution. This is ideal for React, Angular, and Vue.js projects where you can use a pre-packaged component. [11, 12]  
How it works: You install a package via  or  that bundles a collection of crypto logos, often in an optimized SVG format. 

• Library examples: 

	• : A comprehensive library of over 2,500 SVG icons for cryptocurrency tokens. 
	• : A popular library for React, with components for rendering icons. 
	• : A simple React component library that uses icons from the  project. 

• Pros: 

	• Fast performance: Assets are served locally, with no dependency on a network request. 
	• Offline access: Logos are available even without an internet connection. 
	• Customizable: You can manipulate the icons (e.g., change size and color) via CSS. 

• Cons: 

	• Manual updates: You must update the package to get new or changed logos. 
	• Bundle size: Including a large icon library can increase your project's bundle size. [2, 11, 12, 13, 14]  

Method 3: Use a static asset collection If you have a server-side or simple HTML/CSS project, you can download a collection of logos and store them in your project's assets folder. [15, 16, 17]  
How it works: You download a repository or a ZIP file containing the logos as individual image files (PNG, SVG). You then reference these assets directly in your code using a standard  tag. 

• Collection examples: 

	• CryptoLogos: Offers SVG and PNG files for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. 
	• Coinwink GitHub repository: Provides cryptocurrency logos from CoinMarketCap. 

• Pros: 

	• Full control: You have complete ownership of the assets. 
	• No external dependencies: Your project is not reliant on a third-party service. 

• Cons: 

	• High maintenance: You must manually update or add new logos. 
	• Manual scaling: You may need to resize or optimize images for different uses. [15, 18, 19, 20, 21]  

Summary of methods | Integration method [3, 22, 23, 24, 25] | Best for | Requires | Pros | Cons  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API | Real-time data, exchanges, wallets | Fetching data from an endpoint | Always up-to-date, easy maintenance | External dependency, potential cost  |
| NPM Package | React, Vue, Angular components | Installing a package, local assets | Fast performance, offline access | Manual updates, potential bundle size increase  |
| Static Assets | Simple HTML/CSS projects, server-side | Downloading image files | Full control, no external dependency | High manual maintenance  |
