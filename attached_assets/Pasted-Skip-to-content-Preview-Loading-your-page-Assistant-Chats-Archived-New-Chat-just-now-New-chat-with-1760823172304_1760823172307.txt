Start migrating import from Replit Agent to Replit environment
1 minute of work
Ok now that we have it up and running, we need to do somethings, first let's look at the Aequitas Dex dashboard and extra page's in that dashboard, i want to fix the other Cryptocurrencies logo's by respectfully using there actual logos but the images are broken.

The we are almost ready to go live but before I do let's add the Validator Subsidy Protocol to the backend and frontend, this will guarantee self sustainability from day 1.
Instead of just the monthly for what we have gathered we will make sure the subsidy can also cover unforseen expenses.

Once we have completed that then do a full system audit to make sure everything is okay and prepare the Genesis files for update.

I see the issues! Let me fix both the LSP errors in the backend and the cryptocurrency logos visibility. Let me start by examining the specific LSP errors:

I can see the DEX is loading with the REPAR logo visible! Let me check the browser console more carefully and verify the cryptocurrency logo imports. Let me also check if there are missing type definitions for the backend:

Good! The logo files exist. Let me check the actual imports in the SwapInterface component:

Perfect! The imports are correct. Now let me check the backend issues and create the missing type registration files for the validator subsidy module:

Great! I've added the missing type files. Now let me check the current logs and verify the cryptocurrency logos are displaying:

Checked console and system logs
Perfect! The frontend is running smoothly. Let me fix the remaining LSP error and verify the logos are displaying:

Good! I can see the REPAR logo is displaying. Let me fix the LSP errors in the backend and then test selecting different cryptocurrencies to see all the logos:

Good progress! Let me check and fix the remaining LSP errors in the validator subsidy types:
