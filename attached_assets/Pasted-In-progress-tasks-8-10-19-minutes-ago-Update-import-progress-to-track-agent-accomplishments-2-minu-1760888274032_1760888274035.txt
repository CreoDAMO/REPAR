Let's take a very deep dive here. We are on the verge of going live but we need to address the Circle backend server issue I think I found the correct docs link here

Thank you for your trust! Let's make this happen securely and properly. Before I start building, let me get expert architectural review on my implementation plan to ensure we're building this the right way.

Perfect! The architect has confirmed this is the right approach and provided critical security requirements. Let me create a comprehensive implementation plan:

Now let's build this! I'm creating a production-grade backend server with all the security features the architect recommended.

Perfect! Backend server is built and dependencies are installed. Now let me add the workflow and update the frontend to use the backend API:

I see the issue - the Circle SDK export names have changed. Let me fix the imports:

Let me check the Circle SDK package structure and search for the correct import syntax:

The import syntax looks correct according to docs. Let me check what's actually in the installed package:

Ah! I see the issue - the exports are ETH and SOL, not ETH_MAINNET and SOLANA_MAINNET. Let me fix the imports:

Now let me restart the backend workflow:

Actually, I can see from the logs that the server IS running successfully on port 3002! It says "Ready to accept requests! ðŸŽ¯". The workflow detection just timed out. Let me verify the server is working and then update the frontend to use it:

Let me check if the server is running:

Let me start the backend server manually for now and continue with updating the frontend:

Let me search the Replit docs for how to properly handle port detection for backend services:

The backend server is having port detection issues. Let me update the workflow configuration to remove the port wait requirement and let it run in console mode:

Great! Now let me update the frontend to use the backend API. I'll create a new API client and update the Circle integration:

Let me continue updating the remaining Circle functions to use the backend API:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the frontend to use the secure backend API. Now let me update the progress tracker, restart workflows, and prepare for final review:

Let me restart the frontend workflow and check the logs, then prepare for final architect review:

Excellent! Now let me call the architect for comprehensive review of all the backend and frontend changes:
