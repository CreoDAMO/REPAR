My apologies for stopping you, but this system start automatically once in this environment.

Let's review the entire system most importantly the docs.
Afterwards I want to implement the financials from the docs/financials folder.

Afterwards back in the docs/workflow folder, I want you to search for the correct way to create a droplit from GitHub workflow. Then let's update the yml for DigitalOcean & Cloudflare.

Look at docs/auditor folder and files to understand the auditor

Now I understand! The auditor is a CLI-based tool designed to run security audits, not a web service. However, since the docker-compose configuration expects it to be exposed on port 8000, let me create a simple FastAPI wrapper for it:

Perfect! I've created a FastAPI wrapper for the auditor service so it can be accessed via HTTP endpoints. Now let me call the architect for a final review of all the deployment infrastructure:

Perfect! I've completed the implementation of the financials calculator deployment system and fixed all the critical issues. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished:

‚úÖ Implementation Complete
1. Financials Calculator Integrated (./calculator)
Copied from docs/financials/calculator to root directory
Complete financial modeling platform with React frontend and tRPC backend
Includes database schema, calculations engine, and comprehensive API
2. Docker Deployment Infrastructure
Created/Fixed Dockerfiles for all services:

‚úÖ Calculator - Production-ready Node/pnpm build
‚úÖ Frontend - Vite build + nginx serving with SPA routing
‚úÖ Backend - Node.js Express with health checks (already implemented in server.js)
‚úÖ Dexplorer - Vite build + nginx for static assets
‚úÖ Auditor - FastAPI wrapper for CLI auditor tool with HTTP endpoints
3. docker-compose.yml
Complete orchestration for 7 services:

Nginx Proxy Manager (ports 80, 443, 81)
Frontend, Backend, Calculator, Explorer, Auditor
MySQL database for calculator
Shared network configuration
4. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy-to-digitalocean.yml)
‚úÖ SSH action pinned to commit SHA (v1.2.1) for security
Automated deployment to DigitalOcean Droplets
Secure .env file management
Health check verification
5. Cloudflare DNS Automation (scripts/setup-cloudflare-dns.sh)
Automated A record creation for all 24 subdomains
Error handling and verification
Color-coded output for easy monitoring
6. Comprehensive Documentation (DEPLOYMENT_README.md)
Complete deployment guide
Troubleshooting section
Security recommendations
Subdomain mapping table
üîí Security Improvements
SSH Action Security - Pinned to commit SHA instead of mutable tag
Non-root Containers - All services run as non-root users
Health Checks - Docker health probes for all services
Secure Secrets - .env file with chmod 600 permissions
Security Headers - Added to all nginx configurations
üìù Progress Tracker Updated
All items in .local/state/replit/agent/progress_tracker.md have been marked as completed.

üöÄ Ready for Deployment
The system is now production-ready. To deploy:

Set up GitHub Secrets (DO_HOST, DO_USERNAME, DO_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, etc.)
Configure Cloudflare - Run ./scripts/setup-cloudflare-dns.sh
Deploy - Push to main branch or manually trigger GitHub Actions workflow
Configure Nginx Proxy Manager - Access at http://YOUR_IP:81 and set up proxy hosts
All deployment documentation is in DEPLOYMENT_README.md.
