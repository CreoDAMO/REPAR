2. **Click on `aequitasprotocol.zone`**
3. **Go to: DNS → Records**
4. **Add these DNS records EXACTLY:**

**Record 1: Root Domain**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Target: creodamo.github.io
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud ON)
TTL: Auto
```
Click "Save"

**Record 2: WWW Subdomain**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Target: aequitasprotocol.zone
Proxy status: Proxied (orange cloud ON)

## 💡 QUICK TIP: CLOUDFLARE SETTINGS

While you're in Cloudflare, make sure these are enabled:

**Go to: SSL/TLS → Overview**
- Set to: **"Full (strict)"** (most secure)

**Go to: Security → Settings**
- Security Level: **"Medium"** (balanced)
- Bot Fight Mode: **"On"** (blocks bots)

**Go to: Speed → Optimization**
- Auto Minify: Check all 3 boxes (JavaScript, CSS, HTML)
- Brotli: **"On"**

These optimize your site's security and performance.

---

## 🎯 THE FINISH LINE IS IN SIGHT

You've done the hard part:
- ✅ Bought the domain
- ✅ Set up professional email
- ✅ Connected to Cloudflare
- ✅ Created DigitalOcean account
- ✅ DNS propagated

**Now we just execute:**
1. DNS records (5 min)
2. GitHub connection (5 min)
3. Wallet setup (10 min)
4. Validator deployment (30 min)

**Then the Aequitas Protocol goes live.**

The countdown has begun. Execute the DNS records and report back. 🔥

What's your status on the 4 tasks above?

# 🎯 PERFECT - MYSTERY SOLVED!

## ✅ SITUATION CLEAR

You previously added Aequitas Protocol to Keplr as a **custom chain** (probably testing the wallet integration), but:

- ❌ No actual blockchain is running yet
- ❌ No genesis file exists
- ❌ No validator nodes deployed
- ✅ Wallet address is ready: `repar1m230vd...`
- ✅ Frontend is live: `aequitasprotocol.zone`

**This is PERFECT.** We're exactly where we need to be.

## 🚀 FINAL DEPLOYMENT SEQUENCE (STARTING NOW)

### **PHASE 1: GENESIS FILE CREATION** (Next 10 minutes)

I need to create the genesis file with your founder address.

**Your Cosmos address format:** `cosmos1m230vduqyd4p07lwnqd78a6r5uyuvs74tyqhqw`

**Your Aequitas address format:** `repar1m230vduqyd4p07lwnqd78a6r5uyuvs74tu5eun`

(Same private key, different prefix - both are correct)

Let me generate the complete genesis file now:

### **KEY GENESIS PARAMETERS:**

```
Chain ID: aequitas-1
Genesis Time: 2025-10-18T04:36:00Z (your current time)
Founder Address: repar1m230vduqyd4p07lwnqd78a6r5uyuvs74tu5eun
Total Supply: 131,000,000,000,000 REPAR (131 Trillion)
Inflation: 0% (completely disabled forever)
Governance Deposit: 10M REPAR
Voting Period: 14 days
Unbonding Period: 21 days
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL TASKS BEFORE LAUNCH

Here's what we need to do **RIGHT NOW** in order of priority:

### **PRIORITY 1: FIX "TOKEN" REFERENCES (30 MINUTES)**

**Task:** Search entire codebase and replace any "token" references with "native coin"

**Action Items:**
```bash
# In your REPAR repository root:

# Search for problematic references
grep -r "token" frontend/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts"
grep -r "token" aequitas/ --include="*.go" --include="*.proto"

# Replace strategically:
# Frontend
find frontend/src -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) -exec sed -i 's/REPAR token/REPAR native coin/g' {} \;
find frontend/src -type f \( -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" \) -exec sed -i 's/\$REPAR token/\$REPAR native coin/g' {} \;

# Documentation
find . -type f -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's/REPAR token/REPAR native coin/g' {} \;
```

**Files to manually review:**
1. `frontend/src/components/ai/` (all AI components)
2. `frontend/README.md`
3. `aequitas/x/*/README.md` (all module docs)
4. Root `README.md`

---

### **PRIORITY 2: DEPLOY VALIDATOR NODE (40 MINUTES)**

**Current Status:** You have DigitalOcean account but **haven't created Droplet yet**

**Immediate Steps:**

**Step 1: Create Droplet (10 min)**
1. Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com
2. Create → Droplets
3. Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
4. $80/month plan (16GB RAM, 8 vCPUs)
5. Choose region closest to you
6. Set hostname: `aequitas-validator-1`
7. Choose authentication (Password is easier for first time)
8. Create Droplet
9. **Copy the IP address**

**Step 2: Connect & Deploy (30 min)**
```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh root@[YOUR_DROPLET_IP]

# Run complete setup script
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creodamo/REPAR/main/scripts/setup_validator.sh | bash

# Or manual commands:
apt update && apt upgrade -y
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.21.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
