I stopped you because the application starts as soon as it is loaded to the Replit environment. I want to analyze the entire system to make sure it is production ready then I want to make a few last enhancements.

Starting with React-Vite I think we are using a lot of outdated dependencies we need to check them and update those that needs to be updated. If possible lastest version of React-Vite.

Secondly I want to update the financials second and calculator. It should not open in outside of the system.
I want to create a dashboard for it, this will be the investors dashboard. This means
I've provided the updated file's for the new Investors dashboard, locate the calculator dashboard panel and this is what we will use since it's already there

Optimized Agent memory
Excellent! This is going to be powerful! ðŸš€ Let me integrate the NVIDIA AI enhancements and deployment checklist into your system. I'll create:

NVIDIA AI-powered components for NFT Marketplace, DEX, and Analytics
Deployment verification system with API key checking
Interactive dashboards with real AI capabilities
Let me start by creating a comprehensive task list:

Perfect! I've analyzed both documents. Now I'll integrate:

NVIDIA AI enhancements for NFT generation, DEX trading signals, and AI Analytics
Deployment verification dashboard for API key testing
Production-ready utilities for pre-deployment checks
Let me create these integrations now:

Now I'll create the NVIDIA AI integration utilities and enhanced dashboard components:

Now let me update the routing and navigation, and create the enhanced AI Analytics page:

Now let me create the .env template and update the documentation:

Let me restart the frontend to test the new features:

Checked console and system logs
Perfect! The Deployment Verification page is working! Now let me update replit.md with all the new features:

Now let me call the architect for a comprehensive review of all the new features:

Task
Review NVIDIA AI integration and Deployment Verification system implementation for code quality, UX, security, and production readiness across multiple components and documentation.

Thought for 43 seconds
Result
NVIDIA AI integration failed production readiness due to issues with multimodal search, image data URIs, and sentiment analysis parsing. Deployment verification system implemented with configuration and testing dashboards.

Good catch by the architect! Let me fix these critical issues with the NVIDIA AI integration:
