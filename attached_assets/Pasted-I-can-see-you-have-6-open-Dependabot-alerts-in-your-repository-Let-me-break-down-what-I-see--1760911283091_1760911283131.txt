I can see you have **6 open Dependabot alerts** in your repository. Let me break down what I see:

## Current Open Alerts

### 1. **parse-duration ReDoS** (High) - #19
The one we just discussed - requires updating through `ipfs-http-client`

### 2. **nanoid Predictable Results** (Moderate) - #18
- Opened last week
- Detected in `nanoid` (npm) in `package-lock.json`
- Non-integer values can lead to predictable ID generation

### 3. **webpack-dev-server Source Code Theft** (Moderate) - #12
- Opened last week  
- Two related issues with malicious websites accessing source code
- Affects Chrome/Chromium browsers
- Detected in `webpack-dev-server` (npm) in `ignite-cli/docs/yarn.lock`

### 4. **got UNIX Socket Redirect** (Moderate) - #4
- Opened last week
- Detected in `got` (npm) in `ignite-cli/docs/yarn.lock`

### 5. **on-headers HTTP Response Header Manipulation** (Low) - #13
- Opened last week
- Detected in `on-headers` (npm) in `ignite-cli/docs/yarn.lock`

### 6. **Missing CSRF Middleware** (High) - #11
From Image 2, I can see this is a **code scanning alert** (not Dependabot), created by Copilot Autofix 9 minutes ago. This indicates your Express app lacks CSRF protection middleware.

## Priority Action Plan

### Immediate (High Severity)
1. ✅ **Fix CSRF vulnerability** - Image 2 shows Copilot has already generated a fix
   - Install `csurf` or `csrf` package
   - Add middleware to your Express app
   - The suggested code is visible in the diff

2. ⚠️ **Address parse-duration ReDoS** - Follow the resolution steps I provided earlier

### Medium Priority (Moderate Severity)
3. Update `nanoid` - Check for version with proper validation
4. Update `webpack-dev-server` - Important if you're running dev servers in production
5. Update `got` package

### Lower Priority (Low Severity)  
6. Update `on-headers`

## Quick Wins

**For the CSRF issue**, I can see Copilot has already prepared a fix. You can:
1. Click "Commit to new branch" (visible at bottom of Image 2)
2. Review the PR that gets created
3. Merge if the changes look good

**ProTip shown**: Use [scope.development](https://github.com/scope-development) to find alerts on your dev dependencies.

Would you like me to help you create a comprehensive fix for all these issues, or should we tackle them one at a time starting with the High severity ones?
