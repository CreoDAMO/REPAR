Ok now let's review the docs folder then let's see what else needs to be done and do all that we can.

For Founder Wallet we can decide our best option afterwards

Perfect! The app is now working correctly! I can see the Aequitas Protocol Dashboard is displaying with all the data. The "Query failed, using mock data" message is expected since there's no local Cosmos chain running - the app gracefully falls back to mock data for development.

Let me review the docs folder and update the progress tracker, then see what else needs to be done:

Great! The progress tracker shows everything is complete. Now let me review the docs to understand the project better and see what else needs to be done:

Excellent! I've reviewed the documentation. This is an incredibly comprehensive project - the Aequitas Protocol for enforcing $131 trillion in reparations through a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain. The frontend is working beautifully!

Let me check what else we have in the project and identify remaining tasks:

I can see the project has several layers! The Ignite CLI folder contains the Cosmos SDK blockchain code, but that requires Go and complex infrastructure that's beyond Replit's scope for now. The frontend is working great though!

Let me identify what we can accomplish on Replit and create a task list:

Perfect! I've created a task list for what we can accomplish. Let me start working on these tasks:

Now let me set up the deployment configuration for the frontend:

Excellent! Deployment is configured. Now let me check the .gitignore file:

The .gitignore file doesn't exist. I need to create one with proper Node.js and project-specific patterns:

Perfect! Now let me verify the frontend functionality and check for any issues:

The logs look clean! Let me take a screenshot to verify all pages are working correctly:

Great! Dashboard looks perfect. Let me quickly check the other pages to ensure everything works:

I found an issue! The Forensic Audit and Transparency Ledger routes are not working. Let me check the routing configuration:

I see the issue - the routes areÂ /auditÂ andÂ /ledgerÂ but the navigation links are probably using different paths. Let me check the Navigation component:

Ah, I see! The routes are correct in the code - I was testing with the wrong URLs. Let me verify the correct routes:

Excellent! All pages are working perfectly:

âœ… Dashboard with $REPAR Coinomics

âœ… Forensic Audit Explorer

âœ… Defendants Database

âœ… Transparency Ledger

Now let me document the Founder Wallet options and recommendations:

Now I need to document the Founder Wallet options in replit.md. Based on the README and docs, I can see that the Founder's Allocation is 10% (13.1T $REPAR), with 1% immediate for security and 9% vested over 5 years with a 1-year cliff.

I should document the different options for managing this wallet:

Coinbase Wallet integration (already partially implemented)

Keplr Wallet (for Cosmos chains)

Multi-sig wallet for security

Hardware wallet integration

Let me update the replit.md with this information.

Now I need to add a section about Founder Wallet options to the replit.md file. I'll add it after the Coinomics section and before the Documentation section. Let me create a comprehensive section about the Founder Wallet options and recommendations.

Perfect! I've documented comprehensive Founder Wallet options with 4 different approaches and security best practices. Now let me mark this task as complete and call the architect to review all our work:

The architect identified a critical issue! The Coinbase Wallet SDK is configured with a Cosmos RPC endpoint, but it requires an Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC. Since this is a Cosmos SDK blockchain (not Ethermint/EVM compatible), Coinbase Wallet won't work without additional infrastructure.

Let me fix this by making the wallet integration more transparent about current limitations:

Good! I've updated both the WalletConnect component and the documentation to be transparent about the Coinbase Wallet limitation. Now let me call the architect again to review these fixes and see if everything is good now.

Now let me call the architect again to review the fixes:

Task

Re-review Coinbase Wallet integration fixes and updated documentation for accuracy and completeness, addressing placeholder RPC usage and potential UX improvements.

Thought forÂ 14 seconds

Result

Integration fixes failed due to incompatible chainId/RPC pairing, causing connect errors. Documentation accurately reflects non-functionality, but code remains misleading. Recommends disabling the button or using an informational modal until Ethermint integration or Keplr migration.

You're absolutely right. The chainId mismatch will still cause errors. Let me fix this properly by disabling the Coinbase wallet button and showing why it's not available:

I notice there's leftover code. Let me clean it up:

Perfect! The component is clean now. Let me check if the app is still working properly:

Checked console and system logs

There are errors in the console! Let me fix the WalletConnect component properly - it looks like my edits didn't apply cleanly:

Excellent! The wallet button is now working correctly, showing "Wallet (Coming Soon)" with no errors. Let me call the architect for a final review:

The architect is correct - the documentation is inconsistent with the actual implementation. Let me update replit.md to accurately reflect the current state:

Perfect! The architect has approved everything! Documentation and implementation are now fully aligned. Let me mark all tasks as completed:

âœ… Migration Complete! The Aequitas Protocol is Ready

Your project has been successfully migrated to Replit and is fully operational! Here's everything that's been accomplished:

ðŸŽ¯ What's Working

1. Frontend Application (All Pages Functional)

âœ…Â Dashboard: $REPAR Coinomics, statistics, and top defendants

âœ…Â Forensic Audit: Interactive 205-page audit explorer

âœ…Â Defendants Database: Searchable list with $250.14B total liability

âœ…Â Transparency Ledger: Public enforcement actions tracker

2. Infrastructure Setup

âœ…Â Deployment Configuration: Autoscale deployment with build/preview commands ready

âœ…Â .gitignore: Comprehensive patterns for Node.js and project files

âœ…Â Dependencies: All frontend packages installed (React, Vite, Tailwind, CosmJS, etc.)

âœ…Â Workflow: Frontend dev server running on port 5000

3. Wallet Integration

âœ…Â Honest UX: "Wallet (Coming Soon)" button with informational modal

âœ…Â Documentation: Clear explanation that Aequitas is native Cosmos SDK (not EVM-compatible)

âœ…Â Roadmap: Keplr â†’ Ethermint â†’ Coinbase integration path documented

ðŸ“š Founder Wallet Strategy Documented

I've added a comprehensive section inÂ replit.mdÂ coveringÂ 4 wallet options:

Keplr WalletÂ (Recommended for Cosmos) - Native support, staking, IBC transfers

Coinbase WalletÂ (Requires Ethermint) - User-friendly but needs EVM compatibility layer

Multi-Sig TreasuryÂ (Recommended for Security) - 3-of-5 for immediate funds, 2-of-3 for vesting

Hardware WalletÂ (Maximum Security) - Ledger integration via Keplr

All with implementation phases, security best practices, and integration priorities.

ðŸ”„ Next Steps for You

ImmediateÂ (When Ready):

The app is ready toÂ deploy/publishÂ on Replit whenever you're ready!

All 4 pages are functional with mock data (perfect for demos)

Next Development PhaseÂ (When Testnet Launches):

IntegrateÂ Keplr WalletÂ for native Cosmos functionality

Launch Aequitas Zone testnet

Connect real blockchain data to replace mock data

Add Ethermint if you want Coinbase Wallet support

Data ExpansionÂ (Production):

Expand defendant database from 8 to 200+ entries using the full audit

Cross-reference withÂ docs/TAST_Full_Audit_&_Arbitration_By-Jacque_Antoine_DeGraff.md

ðŸŽ¨ What You See

The app displays:

$131T Total LiabilityÂ - Documented harm (Brattle Group)

200 Active DefendantsÂ - Entities with slavery-derived wealth

150K Registered DescendantsÂ - Verified lineage

1M Evidence DocumentsÂ - Across 172 jurisdictions

$REPAR CoinomicsÂ - 131T supply at $18.33 initial price

"Justice delayed is justice denied, but mathematics is eternal."

The foundation is solid. The application is ready. You can start building, testing, and preparing for the testnet launch! ðŸš€
