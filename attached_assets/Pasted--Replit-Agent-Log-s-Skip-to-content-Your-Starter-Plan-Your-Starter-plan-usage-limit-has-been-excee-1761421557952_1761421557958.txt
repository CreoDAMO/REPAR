Fix issues with blockchain build process in GitHub workflow
7 minutes of work
These are the errors

49 minutes ago
I see there are more errors from the actual GitHub build! These are different from the ones we just fixed - they're related to missing codec registration functions and other module setup issues. Let me fix all of these systematically.

Let me start by checking what's actually in these module and types files to fix the missing functions:

Good, I can see the issues. Let me fix them all in parallel:

Now I can see all the issues. Let me fix them all in parallel:

Now let me fix the justice msg_server to match the protobuf RPC definition:

Let me check the validatorsubsidy keeper and add the missing methods:

I can see the validatorsubsidy module needs several missing methods. Let me add them:

Excellent! I've made significant progress fixing all the blockchain compilation errors. Let me call the architect to review all these changes with the full git diff:

Let me now call the architect to review all the blockchain compilation fixes:

Good catch by the architect! I need to fix the context type mismatch in validatorsubsidy. Let me fix that immediately:

Perfect! Fixed the context type mismatch. Now let me update all tasks to completed and call the architect for final approval:

Optimized Agent memory
Let me call the architect one final time to confirm all compilation issues are resolved:

Good catch! I need to fix the module.go file to pass the authority parameter. Let me find and update it:

I can see the issue. The validatorsubsidy keeper needs an authority field. Let me fix this properly:

Good! Now I need to find where the validatorsubsidy keeper is being instantiated and update the call to include the authority parameter:

Let me read the app.go file around where the ValidatorSubsidyKeeper is instantiated:

Let me use the search_codebase tool as suggested in the feedback to find the ValidatorSubsidyKeeper instantiation:

Let me read the app.go file directly to find the ValidatorSubsidyKeeper instantiation:

I can see the app uses dependency injection. Let me check the LSP errors to see what's broken:

Checked code issues
Let me check if the validatorsubsidy module has a provider function for dependency injection:

Let me check how other modules with authority provide their keepers:

Let me check the LSP errors in the validatorsubsidy module.go:

Checked code issues
Perfect! I can see the error on line 61 - it's the cached error from before I reverted the NewMsgServerImpl changes. The error says it needs (keeper.Keeper, string) but I already reverted it back to just (keeper.Keeper). Let me check for the app_config file:

Let me check if the validatorsubsidy keeper actually uses the authority field:

Let me check how the justice module handles authority:

Let me check how the justice module is wired in the app - it also has an authority parameter:

The simplest fix is to revert the NewKeeper changes and use a default authority. Let me do that:

Perfect! Now let me call the architect for final confirmation that all issues are resolved:

Excellent catch by the architect! The hardcoded address won't work for the Aequitas chain. Let me fix it properly:

Perfect! Now let me call the architect for final approval with the corrected authority implementation:

Task
Perform final review of the authority implementation fix in the ValidatorSubsidy keeper and check for any remaining compilation blockers before GitHub Actions build.
