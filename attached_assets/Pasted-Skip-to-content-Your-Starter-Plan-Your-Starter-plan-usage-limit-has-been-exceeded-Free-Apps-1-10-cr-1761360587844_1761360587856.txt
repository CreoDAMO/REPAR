Let's check the actual GitHub workflow Blockchain deployment yml because it wasn't triggered in my last push. Then let's see if we can trigger it

I see you sent "A" - just acknowledging my previous message?

Let me quickly check the LSP errors in the dex.pb.go file:

Checked code issues
Perfect! The LSP confirms the exact duplicate declarations:

Pool redeclared (line 31)
LiquidityPosition redeclared (line 112)
SwapRoute redeclared (line 166)
These are coming from the models.go file I removed earlier. Let me verify it's gone and check if we need to remove any other conflicting files:

Good! models.go is deleted, but we still have msgs.go, query.go, and genesis.go which likely have duplicate declarations too. Let me check them:

I found the issue! All these files have duplicate type declarations:

msgs.go → Defines MsgCreatePool, MsgAddLiquidity, etc. (also in tx.pb.go)
query.go → Defines QueryPoolRequest, QueryPoolResponse, etc. (also in query.pb.go)
genesis.go → Likely defines genesis types (also in genesis.pb.go)
🎯 Here's What We Need To Do:
You have two options to fix the blockchain build:

Option A: Delete Manual Files & Use Protobuf Only ⭐ (Recommended - Fast)
# Run this to remove ALL conflicting files
cd aequitas/x/dex/types
rm -f msgs.go query.go genesis.go
# Then commit protobuf files
git add ../**/types/*.pb.go
git commit -m "Use protobuf-only types, remove manual duplicates"
git push
Pros: Quick, clean, protobuf is source of truth
Cons: May need to add helper methods back

Option B: Keep Manual Files & Remove Protobuf
Delete all .pb.go files and don't generate protobuf.

Pros: Keep your manual code
Cons: Lose protobuf benefits, more maintenance

❓ What Would You Like To Do?
Go with Option A - I'll delete the conflicting files and prepare for commit
Go with Option B - I'll remove protobuf files instead
Something else - Tell me your preference
Just let me know which approach you prefer!
