I'm inches away from going live on Testnet, before that id possible, we need to fix the DEX, there's four taps in that dashboard, DEX, Liquidity, Pools & About.
The first 3 panels are not working properly.In the DEX, when trying to switch between different crypto's the screen goes black.
In the Liquidity tap, we need to make sure the same logos being used in the DEX are the same in here too.
In the Pools tap, as soon as you click on it it goes black screen, also there's 15 Coin's not Token's in the DEX, there should be 15 Coin's in the Liquidity tap and 15 Coin's in the Pools Tap. No where in this platform $REAPAR should be referred to as a token. It is the native coin of Aequitas Protocol Blockchain not a token.
If the Endowment or anywhere where $REPAR is located and or mentioned as a token needs to be replaced. This means even anywhere that mentions Tokenomics, should be Coinomics. Check the Nvidia Holographic rendering sections to update the wording.

I'll help you fix the DEX before going live on Testnet. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the DEX structure and identify the issues.
Let me search for the DEX components using grep:
Perfect! I found the key files. Let me read the AequitasDEX component and related files:
Perfect! I can see the issues. Let me create a task list to fix all the DEX problems and update the terminology from "token" to "coin" throughout the platform.
Now let me start fixing these issues. First, I'll search for all files that need the tokenâ†’coin terminology update:
Let me read the REPAREconomics file to see the Tokenomics section that needs updating:
Now let me start fixing the issues. First, I'll fix the SwapInterface component to prevent black screens when switching cryptocurrencies:
Now let me update the terminology in SwapInterface from "token" to "coin":
Now let me update the LiquidityInterface similarly:
Now let me fix the Pools tab in the AequitasDEX component - it's missing one coin (BNB is there but should be shown as 15 total). Let me update it to ensure all 15 coins are displayed and fix the CryptoIcon component:
Wait, I made an error - I duplicated USDC. Let me fix that. Actually, looking at the list, there are already 14 pairs (REPAR with 14 other coins = 15 coins total). That's correct. Let me remove the duplication:
Now let me update the terminology from "token" to "coin" in other files. Let me start with the REPAREconomics page:
Now let me update the Dashboard and FounderEndowment files:
Now let me update these files to replace "Tokenomics" with "Coinomics":
Let me now check the GRC file and search for Nvidia Holographic sections:
Let me update the GRC file to change "Token Classification" to "Coin Classification":
Now let me update the progress tracker file and my task list:
Good! Now let me restart the Frontend workflow to test the changes:
Now let me check the logs and take a screenshot to verify everything is working:
Checked system logs
Perfect! The workflows are running. Let me take a screenshot of the DEX to verify it's working:
Great! The DEX is loading correctly. Now let me call the architect to review all the changes I made:
Good catch! The architect found remaining "token" references. Let me fix those:
Found it! Let me update that line and search for any other "token" mentions in the file:
Perfect! No more "token" mentions found. Let me restart the workflow and call the architect again for final review:
Now let me call the architect again to review the final changes:
Oh no! I missed updating all the variable references. Let me check the logs first and then fix all remaining references:
Checked console and system logs
Let me take a screenshot to check if the page is working, and also check for any errors:
Actually, the page is loading correctly! Let me verify all tabs are working by taking screenshots of each:
Perfect! No remaining token references. Let me update the task list and call the architect for final review:
