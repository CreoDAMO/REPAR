# AEQUITAS PROTOCOL ($REPAR)

Repository: https://github.com/CreoDAMO/REPAR.git

A Sovereign Layer-1 Blockchain for the Enforcement of Global Reparations.

---

🔥 Mission

The Aequitas Protocol is a decentralized justice system built to execute the findings of the 205-page forensic audit of the transatlantic slave trade. It is a self-funding, AI-accelerated, and legally fortified platform designed to trace, arbitrate, and reclaim the $131 trillion in wealth extracted through historical genocide.

We are not asking for permission. We are enforcing a debt. This protocol is the instrument of that enforcement.

💰 THE $REPAR COIN: THE AEQUITAS STANDARD

$REPAR is the native coin of the Aequitas Zone. Its economic model is a direct reflection of the historical injustice it seeks to rectify.

Economic Foundation

· Total Supply: 131,000,000,000,000 $REPAR (131 Trillion)
· Initial Price: $18.33 via Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP)
· Price Target: $1.00+ (Full Debt Parity)
· Peg: 1:1 with $131 trillion documented harm (Brattle Group)

Economic Engine

· 🔥 Justice Burn: $1 recovered = 1 $REPAR burned (deflationary scarcity)
· 💰 Enforcement Dividend: 4.5% baseline APY staking rewards (15% cap in high-recovery years)
· ⚖️ Dual Compensation: Instant fiat or $REPAR + yields for generational wealth building

Distribution: Justice-First Allocation

Allocation | Percentage | $REPAR Amount | Purpose
---|---|---|---
Community & Descendant Fund | 43% | 56.33T | Airdrops, grants, community programs, staking rewards
Claims & Compensation Fund | 25% | 32.75T | Direct restitution payments, hybrid fiat/$REPAR options
Ecosystem & Enforcement Treasury | 10% | 13.1T | Legal actions, operations (recoverable from defendants)
Founder's Allocation | 10% | 13.1T | 1% immediate security + 9% vested over 5 years (1-year cliff)
Development Fund | 8% | 10.48T | Core team, audits, infrastructure
Foundation Treasury & Reserves | 4% | 5.24T | Long-term network health, strategic partnerships

Compensation & Economy Building

$REPAR serves as the primary tool for compensation, enabling a self-sustaining diaspora economy. 70% of recoveries distributed in $REPAR (with fiat hybrid options via off-ramp); stakers earn yields from ongoing recoveries. Beyond claims, $REPAR powers remittances, investments, DeFi pools, and becomes a reserve currency for the global diaspora, appreciating to $1+ as justice is served.
