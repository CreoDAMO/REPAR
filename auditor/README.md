# Aequitas Cerberus Auditor

## Multi-Agent AI Security System

The Cerberus Auditor is a comprehensive, multi-agent AI security auditing system specifically designed for the Aequitas Protocol blockchain.

### Architecture

The system consists of three AI guilds orchestrated by a master coordinator:

#### 1. **Analyst Guild** (4 AI Agents)
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (Anthropic) - Advanced reasoning and security analysis
- **GPT-4 Turbo** (OpenAI) - General security verification
- **Grok** (xAI) - Novel threat detection
- **Deepseek** - Code analysis specialist

#### 2. **Adversary Guild**
- Simulates attacks to confirm exploitability
- Chaos engineering tests
- Byzantine fault tolerance testing
- Race condition detection
- Front-running vulnerability analysis

#### 3. **Engineer Guild**
- Automated patch generation
- Test case creation
- Security fix verification
- CUDA optimization recommendations

### Usage

#### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set required API keys as environment variables (already configured in Replit)
# - OPENAI_API_KEY
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - XAI_API_KEY (optional)
# - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (optional)
```

#### Run Full Audit

```bash
# From the project root directory
python auditor/orchestrator.py
```

This will:
1. Audit the TAST document (if present)
2. Scan all Go files in the `aequitas` blockchain directory
3. Detect vulnerabilities using 4 AI agents
4. Confirm exploitability through adversarial testing
5. Generate automated patches
6. Save comprehensive reports

#### Audit Specific Document

```python
import asyncio
from auditor.orchestrator import CerberusOrchestrator

api_keys = {
    "openai": "your-key",
    "anthropic": "your-key"
}

orchestrator = CerberusOrchestrator(api_keys, ".")
asyncio.run(orchestrator.audit_document("path/to/document.md"))
```

### Output

All results are saved to:
- **`auditor/reports/`** - Detailed audit reports (JSON format)
- **`auditor/threat_ledger.json`** - Permanent record of all discovered threats

### Consensus Mechanism

Vulnerabilities must meet consensus thresholds to be reported:
- **CRITICAL/HIGH**: Found by 2+ AI agents
- **MEDIUM**: Found by 3+ AI agents
- **LOW**: Found by all 4 AI agents

This reduces false positives and ensures high-confidence findings.

### Security Score

Each audit generates a security score (0-100):
- **95-100**: Excellent security posture
- **85-94**: Good, minor improvements needed
- **70-84**: Moderate issues, patches recommended
- **Below 70**: Significant vulnerabilities, immediate action required

### Integration with Aequitas

The auditor is specifically tuned for:
- Cosmos SDK patterns and vulnerabilities
- Justice Burn mechanism integrity
- Endowment fund time-lock security
- CCTP bridge security
- Governance exploit vectors
- Custom Aequitas modules (x/justice, x/endowment, etc.)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time continuous monitoring
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Automated PR creation for fixes
- [ ] NVIDIA NIM integration for CUDA optimization
- [ ] Testnet deployment for live exploit testing
- [ ] Integration with AgentKit for autonomous security agents

## Philosophy

The Cerberus Auditor embodies the principle: **"The best defense is a relentless offense."**

By combining multiple AI perspectives, adversarial testing, and automated remediation, the system ensures the Aequitas Protocol maintains the highest security standards befitting a $131 trillion justice enforcement mechanism.
