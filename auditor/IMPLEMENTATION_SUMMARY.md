# Cerberus Auditor - Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

The complete Aequitas Cerberus Auditor system has been implemented as specified in the documentation (`docs/auditor/`). This is a multi-agent AI security system specifically designed for the Aequitas Protocol.

## Architecture

### Three AI Guilds

#### 1. Analyst Guild (`auditor/agents/analyst_guild.py`)
- **4 AI Agents working in parallel:**
  - **Claude Sonnet 4** (Anthropic) - Latest model for advanced reasoning
  - **GPT-4 Turbo** (OpenAI) - General security analysis
  - **Grok** (xAI) - Novel threat detection
  - **Deepseek** - Code analysis specialist

- **Capabilities:**
  - Audits Go source code (Cosmos SDK modules)
  - Audits legal/forensic documents (like TAST)
  - Detects: integer overflow, reentrancy, privilege escalation, gas griefing, state inconsistencies, crypto errors
  - Returns findings in structured JSON format

#### 2. Adversary Guild (`auditor/agents/adversary_guild.py`)
- **Exploit Testing:**
  - Confirms if discovered vulnerabilities are actually exploitable
  - Simulates attacks based on vulnerability characteristics
  - Tests Byzantine fault tolerance
  - Tests race conditions
  - Tests front-running vulnerabilities
  - Tests gas griefing attacks

- **Chaos Engineering:**
  - State-level attack simulations
  - Multi-vector security testing

#### 3. Engineer Guild (`auditor/agents/engineer_guild.py`)
- **Automated Remediation:**
  - Generates secure patches for code vulnerabilities
  - Generates corrections for document issues
  - Creates test cases for fixes
  - Provides security rationale for each fix
  - Uses GPT-4 for intelligent patch generation

### Master Orchestrator (`auditor/orchestrator.py`)

The brain of the operation that coordinates all guilds:

**Audit Phases:**
1. **Analysis** - All 4 AI agents scan in parallel
2. **Consensus** - Determine high-confidence threats (found by multiple agents)
3. **Adversarial** - Confirm exploitability
4. **Remediation** - Generate automated patches
5. **Reporting** - Comprehensive JSON reports with security scores

**Consensus Mechanism:**
- CRITICAL/HIGH: Must be found by 2+ agents
- MEDIUM: Must be found by 3+ agents  
- LOW: Must be found by all 4 agents

This eliminates false positives and ensures high-confidence findings.

## Features

### ✅ Dual Audit Modes
1. **Document Auditing** - For legal/forensic documents like TAST
2. **Codebase Auditing** - For Cosmos SDK Go modules

### ✅ Threat Ledger
- Permanent record of all discovered vulnerabilities
- Timestamped entries with full details
- Location: `auditor/threat_ledger.json`

### ✅ Comprehensive Reporting
- JSON format reports
- Security scoring (0-100)
- Severity breakdown (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Automated recommendations
- Saved to: `auditor/reports/`

### ✅ API Integration
- OpenAI (GPT-4 Turbo)
- Anthropic (Claude Sonnet 4-20250514)
- xAI (Grok)
- Deepseek
- All API keys configured in Replit Secrets

## How to Use

### Run Full Audit

```bash
# From project root
python auditor/orchestrator.py
```

This will:
1. Check for and audit TAST document (if present)
2. Scan all Go files in `aequitas/` directory
3. Generate comprehensive reports
4. Update threat ledger

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from auditor.orchestrator import CerberusOrchestrator
import asyncio

api_keys = {
    "openai": "your-key",
    "anthropic": "your-key",
    "xai": "your-key",
    "deepseek": "your-key"
}

orchestrator = CerberusOrchestrator(api_keys, ".")

# Audit a specific document
await orchestrator.audit_document("docs/TAST_Full_Audit_&_Arbitration_By-Jacque_Antoine_DeGraff.md")

# Audit the blockchain codebase
await orchestrator.run_full_audit("aequitas")
```

```

## Aequitas-Specific Features

The auditor is tuned for Aequitas Protocol modules:

- **x/justice** - Justice Burn mechanism integrity
- **x/endowment** - Time-lock security
- **x/cctp** - Bridge security
- **x/defendant** - Defendant tracking
- **x/claims** - Arbitration system
- **x/distribution** - Reparations distribution
- **x/threatdefense** - Chaos defense mechanisms

## Security Score

Each audit generates a score (0-100):
- **95-100**: Excellent - Launch ready
- **85-94**: Good - Minor improvements recommended
- **70-84**: Moderate - Patches should be applied
- **Below 70**: Critical - Immediate action required

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run first audit: `python auditor/orchestrator.py`
2. Review generated reports in `auditor/reports/`
3. Check threat ledger: `auditor/threat_ledger.json`

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD
- [ ] Automated PR creation for fixes
- [ ] Real-time continuous monitoring
- [ ] NVIDIA NIM integration for CUDA optimization
- [ ] Live testnet exploit testing
- [ ] Integration with AgentKit for autonomous agents

## Philosophy

**"The best defense is a relentless offense."**

By combining:
- Multiple AI perspectives (4 agents)
- Adversarial testing (exploit confirmation)
- Automated remediation (patch generation)
- Consensus mechanisms (high confidence)

The Cerberus Auditor ensures the Aequitas Protocol maintains the highest security standards befitting a $131 trillion justice enforcement mechanism.
